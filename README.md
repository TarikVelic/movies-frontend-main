"This website operates on the principle similar to a cinema, where users can register, browse available movies, purchase tickets, and receive all the details via email. Once registered, users can explore the movie selection, choose the desired film, and proceed to purchase tickets for their preferred showtimes. After completing the ticket purchase, all the necessary information, including ticket details and showtime schedules, will be sent to the user's registered email address."
